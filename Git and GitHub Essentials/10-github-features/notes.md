# GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

## GitHub Issues

They can be assigned, labeled, referenced, and discussed with your team.

```

[www.github.com/](http://www.github.com/)<username>/<repository-name>

```

2. Click on the **Issues** tab.  
3. Click **New issue**.  
4. Fill in the **title** and **description**.

## GitHub Pull Requests

Pull requests allow you to **propose changes** to a codebase, enabling discussion and review before merging.

### Workflow:

   Work on a separate branch for your changes.

   Implement fixes or features on this branch.

   - Click on the **Pull requests** tab.
   - Click **New pull request**.
   - Select the branch containing your changes.
   - Fill in the **title** and **description**.
   - Click **Create pull request**.

4. **Review and Discussion:**  
   Team members can review your changes, comment, and request modifications.

5. **Merge:**  
   Once approved, changes are merged into the main branch.

## Task 4: Create Issue and Pull Request

In **Task 3**, you created and pushed the `add-readme` branch. Now, perform the following:

1. **Create an Issue:**  
   - Repository: `personal-blog`  
   - Issue Title: `Add README file`

2. **Create a Pull Request:**  
   - Branch: `add-readme`  
   - Pull Request Title: `Added README file`

> Note: If the `add-readme` branch was recently pushed, GitHub may automatically suggest opening a pull request for that branch.
