# Creating a Remote Repository

## How to Create a Remote Repository on GitHub

Creating a new repository on GitHub is straightforward. Follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Log in to GitHub

Visit your repository page:

```

[www.github.com/](http://www.github.com/)<username>?tab=repositories

```

Click on the **New** button in the top-right corner to create a new repository.

---

### Step 2: Fill in Repository Details

On the **Create a new repository** page, provide the following:

- **Repository Name:**  
  Choose a unique and descriptive name.

- **Description:** *(optional but recommended)*  
  Add a brief description to help others understand your project.

- **Visibility Options:**  
  - **Public:** Anyone can see your repository (good for open-source projects).  
  - **Private:** Only collaborators can access (good for personal or private projects).

- **Initialize Repository Options:**  
  You can choose to initialize the repository with:
  - README file  
  - .gitignore file  
  - License  

> For this task, **do not initialize** the repository with these files. They will be added later.

Click **Create repository** once all details are filled in.  
Your new repository is now live on GitHub.

## Task 1: Create a Remote Repository for Personal Blog

To practice, create a remote repository with the following specifications:

- **Repository Name:** `personal-blog`  
- **Description:** `Source code for my personal blog`  
- **Visibility:** `Private`  
- **Important:** Do **not** initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license at this stage.

> This repository will serve as the remote location where you will **push your local changes** as you work through the course.
