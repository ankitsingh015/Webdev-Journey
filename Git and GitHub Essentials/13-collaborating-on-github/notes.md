# Allowing Access to Your Repository

GitHub allows us to invite collaborators to work on our repositories. This is useful for team projects or pair programming.

## Steps to Allow Access

1. **Navigate to Repository**  
   Go to the main page of your repository where all files and settings are visible.

2. **Access Settings**  
   Click on the **Settings** tab under the repository name. This opens the repository settings page.

3. **Manage Access**  
   On the left menu, click **Access**. Here we can manage permissions for collaborators.

4. **Invite Collaborator**  
   - Click the green **Add people** button.  
   - Enter the username, full name, or email address of the collaborator.  
   - Click **Add `<username>` to `<repository>`** to send the invitation.

5. **Confirm Invitation**  
   The invited person will receive an email. Once they accept, they have access to your repository.

> Using these steps, you can safely manage who can view and modify your code.
