# Staging Files in Git

## What is Staging?

In Git, staging files means preparing them for a commit.  
Think of it like placing items into a package that's ready for delivery â€” only the staged items will be included in the commit.

**Purpose of staging:**

- Identify which changes should be included in the next commit  
- Keep commits organized and focused  
- Avoid accidentally committing incomplete or unrelated changes

### Staging Workflow

1. **Identify Changes:** 
   First, we make changes to files in our project. Initially, these modifications are "unstaged," meaning Git has detected the changes but they are not yet ready to be committed.

2. **Stage Changes:**  
   We explicitly choose which changes to include in the next commit using the `git add` command.

### Examples of Staging

- **Stage a specific file:**

```bash
git add index.html
```

* **Stage all changes in the current directory:**

```bash
git add .
```

* **Stage all changes in the entire repository, including subdirectories:**

```bash
git add --all
```

or

```bash
git add -A
```

### Why Staging Matters

Staging allows us to control exactly which changes we want to commit, making our commits cleaner and more manageable.

This ensures that each commit represents a logical unit of work, improving project history clarity and collaboration.
