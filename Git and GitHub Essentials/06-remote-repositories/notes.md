# Remote Repositories and GitHub

## What is a Remote Repository?

A **remote repository** in Git is a version of your project hosted on the internet or a network.  
It allows you to collaborate with other team members easily by syncing changes between local and remote copies.

**Purpose of a remote repository:**

- Share your project with team members  
- Backup your work online  
- Enable collaboration with multiple developers  

**Example:**  
If you're working on a project with a team, you might host a remote repository on a platform like **GitHub**.  
You can **push** your changes to this remote repository, and your team members can **pull** those changes to their local machines.

Essentially, a remote repository is a **bridge** that connects your local repository to others, enabling collaborative development.

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is an online platform that hosts Git repositories.  
It’s like a social network for developers, allowing you to:

- Store code online  
- Collaborate on projects  
- Track changes and contributions  
- Work on open-source projects  

**How it works:**

- Create repositories to hold your projects  
- Make changes locally and push them to GitHub  
- Team members can pull the latest changes or contribute to your repository  

**Example:**  
If you’re building a website, you can store all your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files on GitHub.  
Your code is accessible, backed up, and ready for collaboration.

**Getting Started:**  
If you don’t have an account yet, you can create one on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
