# Getting Started with JavaScript

## Key Concepts
- JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for web development.
- It enables dynamic interactions on web pages.
- JavaScript code can be executed in the browser's console or through Node.js.

## Notes
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables do not require explicit type declarations.
- Code can be embedded within HTML using the `<script>` tag.
- The `console.log()` function is commonly used to display output in the browser's console.
- Comments in JavaScript can be single-line (`//`) or multi-line (`/* ... */`).
- Basic arithmetic operations and string manipulations are fundamental in JavaScript.

## Example
```javascript
// This is a single-line comment

/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  that spans multiple lines
*/

console.log("Hello, JavaScript!"); // Outputs to the console
